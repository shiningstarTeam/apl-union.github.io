                <p>3-Dimensional Printing has been recognized as one of the dominant core-technologies required in the 4th Industrial
Revolution whose components includes Artificial Intelligence (A.I.), Internet of Things (IoTs), Big Data, Automated
Products, Advanced Materials, etc. These technologies consist of a large number of unlimited synergic elements that can
interact with each other and their environment. A typical characteristic of 3D Printing is a voluntarily-evolving technology
without artificial restrictions.</p>
<p>The <strong> PTCAT-based 3D Printing Research Consortium</strong> was founded in 2016 with the goals of uncovering fundamental
principles governing traditional materials and processing encountered in everyday lives and applying these resolved
principles to solve currently-existing problems through the sophisticated analysis, design, and control of tradition-based
science and technology . Based on the belief that breakthroughs require collaboration across the boundaries of traditional
domains and creative investment in the unresolved area, PTCAT brings together experts in science, engineering, and
manufacturing. Cross-disciplinary collaborations break down barriers due to disciplinary knowledge silos and domainspecific
terminology, accelerating the development of the new science and technology towards high-value added industries..</p>

<p>In 2017, PTCAT launched the 3D Printing Initiative to foster data science research at Hongik Univ. KIST, and KAIST with
the collaboration <br> of Rokit. Please visit the 3D Printing Initiative web site to learn more. 


<p style="margin-top:15px"><strong>Mission Statement</strong></p>


<p>PTCAT's mission is to serve as a hub and facilitator for path-breaking and relevant research in the area of Traditional Culture
and Advanced Technologies, especially 3D printing materials and processing transcending the traditional disciplines .</p>
<p>Our focus is the research and development of novel materials and processing of high value-added 3D printing technologies,
based on traditional (and/or natural) materials and processing. and their application in a wide variety of domains, including
building materials in the forms of paper-, wood-, stone-, and soil-based products. The goal is to understand the traditional
materials and processing through the use of scientific backgrounds and to actively disseminate the results through scientific
publications, education, and corporate development.</p>
<br>


<p style="margin-top:15px" > <strong>Research Resources</strong></p>
<p>PTCAT researchers are distinguished researchers and developers from Hongik University, KIST, KAIST, and Rokit,
participating as outstanding groups in academic and industrial areas. R&D core competencies in 3D Printing Technology
include natural adhesives, soil-based composite, industrial design, process-based simulation, and 3D modelling with special
emphases on novel materials and processing in association with the synergic convergence of traditional culture and
advanced technology.</p>
<p>PTCAT is a research consortium administered by NSE Group of Hongik University, KIST Computational Center of KIST, & Biomedical Group of KAIST.</p>
